<div class="blither">      

<p>The system is based on 3 x  
<a href="http://www.jenconsusa.com/products_specs_1.cfm?id=123">LABS-80K freezers supplied by Jencons </a> and 1 x 
<a href="http://www.statebourne.com/bio_system_series.html">Bio system 36 supplied by Statebourne Cryogenics</a>.
Monitoring and filling is through M505 controllers by <a href="http://www.mowden.co.uk/">Mowden Controls</a>.
Data from  the controllers is logged onto a MySQL database, made available over the web and watched for errors 
by custom Perl scripts running under  
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu</a> on an ancient P4 PC called out of retirement.</p>

<p>The primary Perl script interrogates each unit approximately every 4 seonds.  Data is logged onto the database every 30 minutes, 
unless there is a change in the unit's state, in which case data is logged immediately.</p>


<p>Samples are entirely in vapour phase nitrogen. The periodic spikes in temperature are caused by liquid nitrogen fills 
which boil off vapour and lower the temperature seen by the upper sensor by approximately 10C. Fills are synchronised between 
tanks to reduce liquid nitrogen consumption. The shorter and sharper spikes affecting a single unit are caused by defogging injections of
liquid nitrogen when a lid is opened.</p>

<p><p>Use filtering below to select the freezers and time period displayed. 
   Generally items are selected if they <b><i>contain</i></b> the search 
   terms in the appropriate field; the more you specify the fewer records you will see.
